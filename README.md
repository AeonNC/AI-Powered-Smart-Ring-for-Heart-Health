# AI-Powered Smart Ring for Heart Health Monitoring

Final year capstone project that combines embedded hardware, real-time sensing, and AI to detect cardiac anomalies and trigger automotive safety mechanisms.

## 🔍 Objective
To prevent accidents caused by sudden cardiac events—especially during driving—by:
- Monitoring vitals
- Predicting anomalies using AI
- Triggering emergency protocols (alerts, speed reduction, SMS)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Embedded C | ESP32
- Sensors: MAX30102 (Pulse/Ox), DS18B20 (Temp)
- Python | LSTM Models | Firebase
- IoT Integration (Automotive interface)

## 📦 Project Structure
- `/hardware` – circuit, sensor code, schematics
- `/software` – LSTM model, preprocessing, dashboard
- `/docs` – project report, testing logs

## 🔬 In Progress
- Cloud sync & real-time data storage
- Emergency contact notification system
- Final model validation with test datasets
